Sum of Units Sold: This key performance indicator tracks the total number of units sold offering insight into overall product demand.

Sum of Sales by Segment: This visualization breaks down sales figures by various market segments helping to identify which areas are most profitable.

Sum of Sales by Product: This analysis provides an overview of sales generated by individual products enabling strategic decision-making regarding inventory and promotions.

Sum of Sales by Month: This time-series analysis offers insights into sales trends over time allowing for better forecasting and planning.

Dashboard 2: Profitability Analysis

Sum of Sales by Country: This metric analyzes sales performance across different geographic regions providing insights into market expansion opportunities.

Sum of Profit by Segment: By examining profit margins across segments this dashboard helps identify the most lucrative areas of the business.

Sum of Sales by Product: Similar to Dashboard 1 this feature allows for a focused look at profitability associated with individual product sales.

Together, these dashboards serve as powerful tools for stakeholders enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning to enhance financial performance across various dimensions of the business. The insightful visualizations and aggregations aim to support a deeper understanding of sales trends, product performances and profitability metrics.
