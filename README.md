# Dashboards_on_datasets_in_Microsoft_Power_BI

## Microsoft_Power_BI_Project1

In this project i developed two insightful finance dashboards using Microsoft Power BI leveraging a substantial financial dataset. The first finance dashboard focuses on key sales metrics, showcasing the total sales, total units sold, sales segmented by type, sales by product and monthly sales trends. The second finance dashboard complements the first by highlighting geographical performance, featuring total sales by country, profit analysis by segment and detailed sales figures by product. Together these dashboards provide a comprehensive view of financial performance enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and identify growth opportunities.

## Microsoft_Power_BI_Project2

In this project i developed three comprehensive dashboards based on a large superstore dataset using Microsoft Power BI. The first overall sales dashboard focuses on key performance metrics including total revenue, total profit and total quantity sold supplemented by slicers for order date. It also features aggregations of sales and profit by year, quarter, state, segment and category. The second region and state dashboard dives into financial analyses presenting data by category, state and year with insights into quantity and profit by city, sales by state and category and detailed breakdowns of profits by category and sub-category. The third category and sub-category dashboard emphasizes regional performance and segment analysis showcasing sales and profit figures by category and sub-category as well as quantities by segment. This structured approach enables stakeholders to derive actionable insights and track performance across various dimensions enhancing overall decision-making capabilities in the superstore's operations.
